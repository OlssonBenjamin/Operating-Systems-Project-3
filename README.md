# Operating-Systems-Project-3
In this project, I implemented a userspace filesystem daemon using the FUSE (Filesystem in UserSpacE) 
API to access data in WAD format, the standard used in a number of classic PC game titles (including DOOM 
and Hexen). I implemented read-only access to files and  directories  within  the  WAD  files  as  a  proof-of-concept as well as 
open,  read,  and  release functionality for both files and directories within my FUSE-based program.
